 * This method is called in method update: of CCParticleSystem.m near line 599
 * We overwrite this method here just to inject into the update method, and then
 * we can change the size of each particle
 * 
 * Comparing with the UIKit version: Seems that cocos2d doesn't support child
 * emitter (which means each partitle that was emitted by the particle system 
 * is a new emiiter and can emit its own particle), so we cannot use the same
 * trick as we did with CAEmitterLayer.
